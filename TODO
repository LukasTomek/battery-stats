This file describes bugs that I intend to fix and other things I want to do
to battery-stats.

Please don't report bugs which are already mentioned in here, unless you
can add more information - or even better: a patch.


Different colours on the graph depending on battery state
=========================================================
[Suggested by Werner Heuser <Werner.Heuser@web.de>]
It would be nice if the graph had one colour when the battery was charging,
and another colour when it was discarging.


Battery-graph options for graphs
================================
By default, battery-graph will plot the percentage charge of the battery.
It would be nice to have options like:

    --show-minutes (default)
    --hide-minutes
    --show-percent
    --hide-percent (default)

to better control what is displayed.


Split into more packages
========================
It is quite conceivable that somebody wants to collect battery statistics
on one system and analyze it on another. 

The current package depends on gnuplot - which in turn depends on others
and as a result, battery-stats tends to pull in a lot of packages. Which
can easily be "too much" (somebody define that, please!) for somebody who
just wants the data collected.

It should also be possible to analyze the data on a server system without
having to pull in libapm - most servers have little use for apm. 

Packages:
	battery-stats-collector - the collector
	battery-stats-grapher	- the grapher, depends on gnuplot
	battery-stats		- metapackage, depends on the two above.
